# Decision making statements
## Aim: This repository contains examples and explanations of decision-making statements in C++. 
## Theory : 
Control structures in C++ allow for conditional execution of code blocks. Decision-making statements allow the program to take different paths based on the results of conditions or expressions. The main decision-making statements in C++ include:
1. if statement
2. else statement
3. else if statement
4. switch statement
### if else:
  The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the if condition is false.
#### Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
### if elseif :
  The else if statement is used to check multiple conditions. It follows an if statement and can be used several times.
#### Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}
### Switch case: 
The switch statement is used to choose which of several code blocks will be run. In situations where you have many conditions dependent on a single variable, this is an alternative to utilising multiple else if statements.
#### syntax:
switch (expression) {
    case constant1:
        // Code to execute if expression == constant1
        break;
    case constant2:
        // Code to execute if expression == constant2
        break;
    // Add more cases as needed
    default:
        // Code to execute if none of the cases match
}
